Hi ,I am Sudhanshu Kumar ,currently in 2nd year of Btech cse. My general hobbies include reading,watching movies and my professional hobbies include game development and learning about new technologies.

Now i only done a single task of web development as i am still learning and not so sure about other tasks.Due to college studies and procastination ,it on a standstill. 

 For animation part i struggled a bit and on some minor things.
 About the approach ,i found it within my domain and within my skill range.

 Lastly ,if i got selected i will resume the web development as i was on javascript part and within 2 month i will try to complete both frontend and backend.

 Thanks...
